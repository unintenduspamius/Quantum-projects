# ⚛️ Harish's Quantum Projects – Volume 1

Welcome to **Volume 1** of my quantum computing + Python journey.  
I'm a 14-year-old student from Bangalore building projects as part of my dream to create India's most powerful and accessible quantum computing ecosystem — and one day study at MIT or Princeton.

## 🧠 Project Descriptions

**001 – Hello Quantum World**  
> My first Colab project, used basic Python to print a message and simulate a qubit intro.

**002 – Qubit Simulator (ASCII Edition)**  
> Simulated qubit collapse using `random.choice()` and added fun ASCII visuals.

**003 – Quantum Logic Gate Simulator**  
> Python-based simulation of quantum gates: Pauli-X, Hadamard, and Identity.

**004 – Quantum Flashcards App (Design Stage)**  
> (Coming soon) A beginner-friendly flashcard app to memorize quantum concepts.

**005 – Entanglement Visualizer**  
> (Coming soon) A simulated demo to show how entangled qubits behave.
